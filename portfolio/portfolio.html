        Responsive Design:- <br />
        <p>
          I ensure that your website looks great on all devices. Responsive
          design is an approach in web development that involves creating
          websites that adapt to the user's behavior and environment based on
          the device they are using. It utilizes a combination of flexible
          grids, layouts, images, and CSS media queries to ensure that the
          website adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes and resolutions.
          This design philosophy allows websites to automatically respond to
          changes in the user's platform and orientation, providing an optimal
          viewing experience across various devices like laptops, tablets, and
          smartphones

          Graphic designer and visual communicator Christina Vanessa clearly has
          an eye for aesthetics. The first page we reach on this graphic design
          portfolio example is a simple expression of her creative work and
          personality. There’s a fullscreen looped video showcasing her best
          pieces, with her name and disciplines written above. Following this
          promising introduction, Christina’s ‘Explore’ page is just as
          impressive, incorporating multiple design features. From the works
          themselves to the layered blocks that make up the page’s layout, the
          website’s color scheme is cohesive and neutral. The soft shades of
          cream, beige and gray craft a serene atmosphere, further reinforced by
          the smooth animations.
